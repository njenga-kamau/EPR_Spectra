Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), also called electron spin resonance (ESR), is a technique used to study chemical species with unpaired electrons. EPR spectroscopy plays an important role in the understanding of organic and inorganic radicals, transition metal complexes, and some biomolecules
I measured the EPR signals between tubes that contained FMX, a iron-containing nanoparticle and its excitiation after being treated with radiation 
After measuring the signals I plotted them for a side-by-side comparison
